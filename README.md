# Welcome to my vim plugin repository!

This repository is used to quickly pull my vim plugins onto new machines.

## Installation:
*NOTE*: You will probably want to move the old ~/.vim directory if it already exists to ~/.vim-old if you have a .vim directory

Simply clone this repo in your ~/ directory and run ./install.sh
